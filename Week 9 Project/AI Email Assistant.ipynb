        "As a business leader at Orion Tech Solutions, you (“Alex Carter”) oversee multiple software development and IT infrastructure projects. Your responsibilities include coordinating with stakeholders, managing escalations, and ensuring timely deliveries. With hundreds of emails flooding your inbox daily, manually sorting through them is time-consuming and increases the risk of missing critical updates, client escalations, or project approvals.\n",

        "Objective:\n",
        "The goal of this project is to develop a Generative AI-powered system that:\n",
        "✅ Summarizes emails into actionable insights using the Yesterbox approach (excluding today’s emails).\n",
        "✅ Prioritizes emails based on urgency, sender, and context.\n",
        "✅ Draft context-aware responses to reduce manual effort.\n",

        "Based on the evaluation results, the AI Email Secretary showed mixed performance in generating customer review responses and summaries. While the system demonstrated consistency in output formatting and evaluation handling, the generated summaries frequently lacked substantive content. In several instances, summaries were incomplete or empty, limiting their effectiveness in conveying the intent, context, or required actions from the original emails. However, the evaluation framework itself performed reliably in identifying these gaps and applying scoring consistently across all evaluated responses.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Relevance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The relevance scores were consistently low, indicating that many summaries did not sufficiently reflect the key points or purpose of the original emails. This suggests a gap in the system’s ability to extract and restate meaningful information from the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Clarity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Clarity was also rated low across evaluations, primarily due to the absence of structured or descriptive content rather than confusing language. When content was present, formatting remained consistent, but the lack of detail reduced overall usefulness.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Actionability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Actionability was minimal, as most summaries failed to provide clear next steps or actionable guidance. This limits the system’s effectiveness in operational or decision‑support scenarios, especially for customer‑facing communications.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Strengths**\n",

        "The evaluation process successfully identified deficiencies consistently, demonstrating the robustness of the LLM‑as‑a‑Judge approach.\n",

        "The system provides a solid foundation for improvement once content‑generation issues are addressed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Improvement Areas**\n",
        "\n",
        "The AI Email Secretary should generate more complete, content‑rich summaries that clearly capture email intent and context.\n",
        "Greater emphasis is needed on extracting and explicitly stating action items, deadlines, or customer expectations when present in the original communication.\n",

        "\n",
        "**5. Final Recommendation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the current performance partially meets structural expectations but does not yet meet functional requirements for effective customer review summarization. While the evaluation framework and consistency mechanisms are strong, improvements in content generation and action‑oriented summarization are necessary. With targeted prompt refinement and enhanced content validation, the system has the potential to evolve into a reliable tool for summarizing and responding to customer communications in a production environment."
