        "As a business leader at Orion Tech Solutions, you (“Alex Carter”) oversee multiple software development and IT infrastructure projects. Your responsibilities include coordinating with stakeholders, managing escalations, and ensuring timely deliveries. With hundreds of emails flooding your inbox daily, manually sorting through them is time-consuming and increases the risk of missing critical updates, client escalations, or project approvals.\n",

        "Objective:\n",
        "The goal of this project is to develop a Generative AI-powered system that:\n",
        "✅ Summarizes emails into actionable insights using the Yesterbox approach (excluding today’s emails).\n",
        "✅ Prioritizes emails based on urgency, sender, and context.\n",
        "✅ Draft context-aware responses to reduce manual effort.\n",

The progress looks good overall. A few things:\\n\\n1. Production Analytics Dashboard \\u0096 We had a few folks test it, and they love the real-time visibility. One concern: Can we add historical trend comparisons?\\n2. ML Model \\u0096 If we\\u0092re still at 82%, do we need to collect more training data? What's the biggest blocker?\\n3. ERP Integration \\u0096 I\\u0092ll push my IT team on this. Expect the API docs by Monday, Mar 16.\\nAlso, let\\u0092s discuss the alerting system in detail next week\\u0097want to ensure it aligns with our operational flow.\\n\\nLet me know if we should hop on a quick call.\\n\\nBest,\\nJohn\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"main_recipient\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ian Adams\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Deadline-Driven Emails\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
