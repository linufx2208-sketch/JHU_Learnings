    "As a business leader at Orion Tech Solutions, you (“Alex Carter”) oversee multiple software development and IT infrastructure projects. Your responsibilities include coordinating with stakeholders, managing escalations, and ensuring timely deliveries. With hundreds of emails flooding your inbox daily, manually sorting through them is time-consuming and increases the risk of missing critical updates, client escalations, or project approvals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a Generative AI-powered system that:\n",
    "✅ Summarizes emails into actionable insights using the Yesterbox approach (excluding today’s emails).\n",
    "✅ Prioritizes emails based on urgency, sender, and context.\n",
    "✅ Draft context-aware responses to reduce manual effort. \n",

    "🔹 Total Emails from Yesterday: 100\n",
    "🔹 🛑 Urgent & High-Priority Emails: 10 (Require Immediate Action Today)\n",
    "🔹 ⚡ Deadline-Driven Emails: 8 (Must Be Addressed Today)\n",
